                        application before it is installed on your device. Our tool requires manual input from the user about the physical features of the downloaded 
                        application, such as the file size, name, format, verified source, CPU usage, RAM usage after download, behaviour
                          of the device post-download, if the application has a digital signature, if it passed Chrome's firewall, and from which browser it was downloaded.
                          This comprehensive approach to analysing a downloaded application's physical features allows our tool to detect potential threats that traditional 
                          antivirus software may miss. This proactive approach ensures that your device is protected before any harm can be done. The manual input gives the user more control over
